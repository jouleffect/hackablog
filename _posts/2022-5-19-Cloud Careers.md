### What is Cloudification?
This term is a current way of meaning the migration of a monolithic application to a new system, a cloud system, composed of many microservices, each indipendent of the other, in terms of deploying, lifecyle and location. The most important aim of this kind of architecture is to make as flexible as possible the load balancing and to avoid the fall of the entire application, if only one part of it has a problem. 

Who manages this kind of job?
#### DevOps
This professional figure has several knowledge:
- Docker (containerization platform for applications)
- Kubernetes (container orchestrator)
- GitHub (application integration platform)
- Tensorflow (machine learning platform)
- Jira (monitoring platform)

- Networking Security
- Analytics (datawarehouse design)

and so on...

Google Cloud follows a training path like this:
Product → Solution → Methodology → Delivery

The professional certifications are:
- Cloud DevOps Engineer
- Cloud Architect
- Data Engineer
- Machine Learning Engineer
- Cloud Network Engineer
- Cloud Security Engineer

Hence, to start a career as a DevOps, it is important to have, first of all, a new view of infrastructure, based on the absence of a concrete location of the hardware. It's also important to know many fields of operation, like the one of development, system administration and security.
