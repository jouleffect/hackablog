My nickname is Jouleffect, and my passion is Cybersecurity and Cryptography.
I have always had a deep interest in codes and secret writing. Moreover, when I started going to university, I studied cryptography techniques and I was very enthusiastic about it.

Cybersecurity is not what you think, simply made up of useful tools for pentesting or for discovering passwords. These tools are developed and packaged by computer experts, made available to make the job easier for other computer scientists. But knowledge of true cybersecurity is another. My goal is to discover the background of it in this blog.
